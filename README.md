Hi!
You should really ask your mirror.

Here is what I suggest:

Take a stopwatch, time yourself, and lie about your self. For practice.

Try saying. I am an astronaut, Grew up in Texas, my health is perfect, I like space but I also fear it. I like the color yellow and the smell of the ocean. Divorced, one child...

Then evaluate on what you said and ask - Is this enough to make a new identity? If it's not, try again.

Depending on who you want to impress, there are a few key things about you that can paint a big picture:

Where are you from/where did you grow up.
What kind of education do you have/do you like that path.
Wives, children, parents/family.
Health/problems.
Traveling
What do you value. Health/Money/Happiness.
If you want to impress a potential friend/girlfriend, you can add a bit more detail. If you want to impress an employer, focus on what he needs to know.

Hi, my name is Bojan(It's pronounced Boyan).

I was born in Serbia in a city close to the capital where I've lived so far. I'm 25, married for two years. No kids just yet as we are getting on our feet first. I work abroad within the oil industry like an engineer, although I don't have a degree. Just got lucky I guess. I like my job, love my wife and live for kids that will come one day. What else is there to live for, right?

My country is poor and broken so it's a struggle here, but I'm fine. Always looking at the bright side of life.

My family is...complicated. All you need to know for now is that I have a sister that is closest to me, lives in the capital. She is a future artist(painting/photography) and I am very proud of her.

Overall, I am a very nice, intelligent guy with an amazing sense of humor and a lot of hidden talents.

Hope I helped.
